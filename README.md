Just a Github Pages website about me. This is really just a test, so there isn't much about it here...

# Website Link 🌐
Here is the link: https://spydergamer.github.io/

# Info ℹ
The [`docs`](https://github.com/SpyderGamer/SpyderGamer.github.io/tree/main/docs) folder is where the website's files are located. The website is hosted from the `main` branch. Pretty cool :)
